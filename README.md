# ðŸ“¦ TransBorder Freight Data Analysis (2020â€“2024)


### Project Overview
This project analyzes cross-border freight data from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) for the USA, Canada, and Mexico (2020â€“2024).
The goal is to uncover trade patterns, freight movement trends, top commodities, and transport modes while identifying areas for efficiency improvement and actionable recommendations.

### Key Objectives
Uncover Freight Movement Patterns â€“ Analyze trends in trade value and weight by mode, region, and commodity.

Identify Operational Inefficiencies â€“ Investigate delays and underutilized infrastructure.

Assess Environmental Impact â€“ Evaluate freight weight as a proxy for emissions by mode.

Analyze Economic Disruptions â€“ Assess year-over-year trade fluctuations.

Provide Data-Driven Recommendations â€“ Support decisions on trade efficiency and infrastructure planning.

### ðŸ“‚ Dataset
Source: Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS)

Period: 2020â€“2024

Key Fields: Trade Type, Country, State/Province, Mode of Transport, Value, Weight, Commodity

### Tools Used
Tool	Purpose
Python	Data cleaning, merging, and feature engineering
Pandas/Matplotlib/Seaborn	Data wrangling and EDA
Power BI	Interactive dashboard and data visualization
GitHub	Version control and project documentation

### Methodology (CRISP-DM)
#### Business Understanding
Defined objectives and key business questions (e.g., trade trends, top commodities, mode usage, YoY growth).

#### Data Understanding
Examined structure, missing values, and column meanings using BTS documentation.

#### Data Preparation
Merged yearly CSV files (2020â€“2024).

Cleaned missing values for USASTATE, MEXSTATE, and CANPROV.

Created mappings for trade types, modes, and commodities.

Performed feature engineering (Region column, MonthNumber for sorting, etc.).

#### Modeling / Visualization
Built Power BI dashboards:

Freight Overview & Trends

Freight Weight & Mode Analysis

Regional Freight Distribution

#### Evaluation
Identified top commodities (Machinery, Vehicles, Mineral Fuels).

Trucks dominate freight transport; USA exports lead trade value.

Trade grew until 2022 with slight decline afterward.

### Key Insights
Machinery contributes the highest trade value.

Mineral fuels dominate freight weight.

Trucks are the most used transport mode.

Trade peaked in 2022, then slightly declined.

### Recommendations
Invest in infrastructure upgrades for high-volume truck routes.

Promote logistics optimization to reduce delays and costs.

Support high-value commodities through trade-friendly policies.
